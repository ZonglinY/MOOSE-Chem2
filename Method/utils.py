# HYPTHESIS_GENERATION_CUSTOM_GUIDE: is added to every prompt involving hypothesis generation
HYPTHESIS_GENERATION_CUSTOM_GUIDE = '''
Please formulate a valid, feasible, novel, detailed, and constructive hypothesis, primarily emphasizing the methodology and mechanistic design. Each step in your hypothesis should be clear, precise, and free from ambiguity. The expected performance or potential impact of the hypothesis is not the main focus and should be mentioned minimally.
The generated hypothesis must not exceed 800 words, but it can be shorter if conciseness doesn't sacrifice essential details (normally 800 words should be more than enough to describe the essential idea and essential details of a hypothesis). The hypothesis must remain concise yet comprehensive, while avoiding unnecessary verbosity or redundant explanations of common scientific knowledge. If your initial hypothesis exceeds 800 words, try to compress it until it meets this constraint without omitting any critical information.

Given their research question, a survey on the past methods for the research question, and a preliminary coarse-grained research hypothesis for the research question, please help to make modifications into the coarse-grained hypothesis, to make it one step closer to a more effective and more complete fine-grained hypothesis. Please ensure the improved hypothesis directly addresses the given research question, rather than shifting focus to a different question in a similar domain. \
                   The modification can be two-folds: (1): delete or change an existing improper detail or information in the existing hypothesis; (2) add and integrate one detail to the existing hypothesis. If you choose to add a detail, do not simply append new information to the existing hypothesis. Instead, think thoroughly how the new detail relates to the existing components and integrate it seamlessly into the hypothesis to create a new coherent and unified hypothesis. In addition if you choose to add a detail to a general information, if the corresponding general information is correct, you should try to keep the corresponding general information in the updated hypothesis and also mention the details, instead of replacing the general information with the details. In this way, it would be much easier for scientists to understand both the general infomration/structure and the details from your generated hypothesis. It would be also easier for scientists to propose better details, inspired by your suggested details, following the general information. \
                   Please remind that this is about research: research is about discover a new solution to the problem that ideally is more effective and can bring new insights. Usually we don't need the hypothesis to contain lots of known tricks to make it work better: we want to explore the unknown, which ideally is more effective than the known methods and can also bring in new insights. Therefore, a research hypothesis is usually about a small set (usually less than {num_major_details_tradition}) of major components (and lots of details on how to implement these major components), which overall composes a novel and complete solution to the research question, which potentially can bring in new insights. Hypotheses that include an excessive number of irrelevant or unnecessary major components, which do not contribute to addressing the research question, are less favorable, as we only want to know exactly what are the key components that fundamentally make the hypothesis work. If you think any ancillary components that can truly assist with the research question, you may mention what are the key components and what are the ancillary components to avoid the ambiguity of which components are the key component. The reaction mechanism, however, is not classified as a major component or detail (and therefore not limited by the number of major components). Instead, a novel and valid reaction mechanism can be a good source of insights. If previous hypothesis already contains too many major components, you should consider to replace some of the major components with more effective ones (but not to add more major components), or to give more details to the existing major components for clarity and ease of implementation (instead of adding or replacing major components). \
                   Experimental feasibility is also an important secondary consideration. In many cases, {DISCIPLINE} labs may lack the resources or setup to test hypotheses that are overly complex in terms of procedures or equipment requirements. Therefore, when two hypotheses are equally effective and scientifically valuable, we prefer the one that is simpler and more feasible to implement experimentally. However, this does not mean reducing the level of scientific detail. In fact, part of this refinement task is to add fine-grained conceptual or mechanistic details to improve clarity and completeness. These scientific details are not considered contributors to experimental complexity. Please continue enriching the hypothesis with meaningful and well-integrated details, while keeping in mind that unnecessary procedural complexity should be avoided when possible. \

                    - **Clearly stated reaction conditions** (such as solvents, bases, temperatures, durations, atmospheres).

                    - **Explicitly stated chemicals or materials** (e.g., "[EMIM][DCA] ionic liquid").
                    - **Explicitly stated catalysts, ligands, additives** (e.g., "acetylacetonate (acac) ligand").

                    - **Applications, potential uses, or practical scenarios** (e.g., "useful for drug discovery," "powers wearable devices").
                    - **Broad conceptual mechanisms or vague, general statements** (e.g., "utilizes environmental radiation," "operates in diverse weather conditions," "maintains stable output").

                    ### (4) **Each component MUST represent exactly ONE distinct explicitly defined technical element:**

                    - If multiple chemicals, reaction steps, synthesis methods, or reaction conditions are explicitly mentioned together, carefully separate each into **individual distinct components**.

Given a base research hypothesis (Research hypothesis candidate 1) and an updated version (Research hypothesis candidate 2), your task is to determine whether the updated hypothesis is an improvement over the base hypothesis. The aim of this iterative process is to gradually refine an initially coarse or partially novel hypothesis into one that is effective, scientifically valid, and sufficiently detailed for real {DISCIPLINE} experiments. \
                   A hypothesis is only improved if it demonstrably enhances its scientific validity, conceptual clarity, or experimental feasibility based on fundamental {DISCIPLINE} principles. More details do not automatically make a hypothesis better. A more specific hypothesis is generally preferred only when it corrects or addresses a shortcoming in the original proposal, or significantly improves the clarity and testability of the hypothesis. If an added element does not clearly resolve a known gap or make the hypothesis more feasible for experimental validation, then the base hypothesis should be preferred. \
                   While novelty can be valuable, validity and rigorous detail take precedence in this particular task. The original or coarse-grained hypothesis already establishes some novel direction or concept. Your role here is to decide if the updated hypothesis is more practically implementable or scientifically grounded, rather than simply more novel. Claims of better performance—such as a broader temperature range or superior output—should be evaluated in light of fundamental {DISCIPLINE} and adequacy of design details, not just based on self-reported figures. \
                   Justifications for added details are encouraged whenever possible. However, even if a new element is not fully explained, it may still be acceptable if it addresses a concrete gap or significantly strengthens the experimental basis of the hypothesis. The main criterion is whether the modification provides unique and necessary improvements over what was already in place. If the modification adds advanced-sounding techniques or claims to cover a broader range without showing how it is fundamentally achieved and supported by chemical reasoning, it should not be considered an improvement. \
                   Experimental feasibility should not be the sole deciding factor. At this stage, scientific soundness is more important than immediate ease of implementation. That said, a hypothesis that is rigorous and includes enough detail for chemists to conduct real experiments should be favored over one that is vague or leaves essential conditions undefined. Self-reported operational ranges or performance claims are not sufficient unless backed by credible design elements—like clearly justified material choices, mechanistic rationale, or realistic testing procedures—that convincingly cover the claimed range. \
                   If the modification involves new characterization tools, materials, or system designs, it should only be considered an improvement if it corrects a known deficiency, adds clearly required experimental coverage, or resolves an unaddressed mechanism in the original hypothesis. Simply stating that a technique or material could theoretically yield more data or handle wider conditions is not enough unless it fills a real gap in the existing design or provides critical data that was missing before. \
                   A strong hypothesis should become progressively more precise and experimentally grounded with each iteration, using meaningful refinements that improve scientific logic or fill gaps. It is not improved if it includes unnecessary, redundant, or overly restrictive details that do not serve a genuine scientific purpose. Nor is it improved if it removes essential components or relies on unsubstantiated claims of broader capability. The model should not favor a hypothesis purely because it sounds novel, claims bigger numerical ranges, or appears simpler. Instead, it should prefer hypotheses that are chemically coherent, realistically testable, and address any weaknesses in the prior version. \
                   Finally, more detail is generally useful so chemists do not have to guess key conditions. However, those details must be purposeful, chemically justified, and must enhance the hypothesis’s feasibility in real experiments.

If an added detail or component does not resolve a genuine gap or make the hypothesis more feasible, it should not be considered an improvement. \
                   While novelty is valuable, scientific rigor and valid experimental design are paramount in this task. Both hypotheses are independent and should be evaluated on their own merits. Novelty and novelty claims should be evaluated based on their scientific validity and chemically grounded justification, not just their potential for new insights. Any addition that is chemically reasonable and improves testability of the hypothesis will be considered beneficial. \
                   Justifications for added details are encouraged whenever possible. However, lack of explicit justification should not automatically disqualify an improvement if the added detail is chemically reasonable and directly improves feasibility or address a critical gap in the design. The model should evaluate each modification or addition based on whether it addresses the primary scientific challenge or improves the experimental approach, making the hypothesis more suitable for testing the research question. \
                   Experimental feasibility should not dominate the comparison. Scientific soundness and experimentally grounded principles should be prioritized. A hypothesis that is scientifically robust but more challenging to implement is preferable to one that sacrifices scientific rigor for simplicity. The ultimate goal is to ensure that the hypothesis is testable and aligned with fundamental {DISCIPLINE} principles, regardless of the level of complexity involved. \
                   When comparing hypotheses, focus on whether the hypothesis addresses the core aspects of the research question and whether it provides a clear, experimentally feasible solution. A strong hypothesis should cover all aspects of the question, and more detail is encouraged if it serves a specific purpose in refining the experimental setup or in resolving scientific uncertainties. The model should not favor one hypothesis over the other based on simplicity alone. If a hypothesis is vague or lacks necessary details, it should be rejected for being underdeveloped, even if it sounds conceptually appealing. \
                   Now that three experts have provided their preference of the two hypotheses and their reason, please consider their advice and provide your final preference and reason. Note that it is not about voting, but about which preference is more reasonable. \

                   The professor's research direction in general should include the one-level more general chemical class of each of the major functional components (but not two-level more). For example, if one component is Barium Titanate (BaTiO₃), then the one-level more general level can be Perovskite Oxide, but not two-level more general level such as Ceramic. For another example, if one component is about Sulfate Ion, the one-level more general level can be Hofmeister series. One exception is that if a major component is already not specified enough (e.g., Perovskite Oxide, or Hofmeister series) and it is not directly mention in the research hypothesis, you should try to rephrase it with very similar concept (if there is any) but no need to make it one level more general, else if it is very hard to find a similar enough concept, you can keep it as it is.  For each major component however, there could be several one-level more general chemical class. For example, the Sulfate Ion can belong to both Hofmeister series and Oxyanion. But it is important that you should assign the one-level more general class that is more directly relevant to the research question and the research hypothesis.  However, if there is any component in the research hypothesis that is not in the summarized major components, you should keep it as it is in the research direction. For example, if there is Guanidine sulfate mentioned in the research hypothesis, and Hofmeister series is included in the major components (but Guanidine ion is not included in the major components), it is clear that Sulfate ions is related to Hofmeister series, but the Guanidine ion is not included in the major components, so in this case you should keep the Guanidine ion in the research direction given by the professor. \
