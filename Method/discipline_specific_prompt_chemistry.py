# hypothesis examples to show to the framework, as the goals
hyp_example_hierarchy_1 = "The reaction mechanism of the engineered enzyme SNAr1.3 in nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) involves the nucleophilic attack on the electron-deficient aromatic ring, facilitated by the enzyme’s active site. The enzyme stabilizes the transition state through a halide-binding pocket formed by key residues like Arg124 and Asp125, which help position and activate the electrophilic substrate. Arg124 plays a crucial role by acting as a hydrogen-bond donor, assisting in the activation and proper positioning of the nucleophile for efficient attack. The process proceeds via a non-covalent pathway, with no evidence of covalent enzyme-substrate intermediates, ensuring high selectivity and catalytic efficiency."
hyp_example_hierarchy_2 = "This hypothesis describes the engineered enzyme SNAr1.3, which catalyzes nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) reactions. The general components required for this reaction include an electron-deficient aromatic electrophile and a nucleophile capable of attacking the electrophilic carbon. The enzyme’s halide-binding pocket plays a critical role in stabilizing the transition state by holding the halide in place and facilitating its departure as the leaving group. The nucleophile is activated by the enzyme, which positions it for a precise nucleophilic attack on the aromatic ring. The hydrogen-bonding interaction between the enzyme and nucleophile ensures that the nucleophile is correctly oriented and activated, which is essential for achieving selectivity and stereocontrol in the reaction. The mechanism proceeds through a non-covalent pathway, without forming covalent enzyme-substrate intermediates, allowing the enzyme to efficiently catalyze the reaction with high selectivity and catalytic efficiency. These general components are essential for ensuring the enzyme’s ability to selectively catalyze the nucleophilic substitution reaction."
hyp_example_hierarchy_3 = "The engineered enzyme SNAr1.3 catalyzes nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) reactions, where the nucleophile attacks the electron-deficient aromatic electrophile, displacing the halide as the leaving group. The electrophile must be electron-deficient, often through the presence of electron-withdrawing groups like nitro or trifluoromethyl, which make the carbon attached to the halide more reactive. Specific examples of such electrophilic substrates include 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene. The nucleophile, typically a carbon-based nucleophile such as ethyl 2-cyanopropionate, provides the electron pair required to displace the halide. This nucleophile is often in an enolate form, which the enzyme activates to enhance its nucleophilicity.\nThe enzyme’s halide-binding pocket, formed by Arg124 and Asp125, stabilizes the transition state and facilitates the departure of the halide leaving group. This pocket ensures that the halide is properly aligned for efficient departure, lowering the activation energy for the substitution. Arg124 acts as a hydrogen-bond donor, interacting with the nucleophile and ensuring its activation and proper positioning for nucleophilic attack on the electrophilic carbon. This hydrogen-bonding is crucial for achieving the selectivity and stereocontrol of the reaction. The reaction proceeds via a non-covalent mechanism, avoiding covalent enzyme-substrate intermediates, which distinguishes it from traditional SN1 or SN2 pathways. The enzyme's active site, with its precise arrangement of residues, ensures high selectivity, efficiency, and stereocontrol, enabling it to catalyze reactions with a broad range of electrophiles and nucleophiles."
hyp_example_hierarchy_4 = "The engineered enzyme SNAr1.3 catalyzes nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) reactions, where a nucleophile attacks an electron-deficient aromatic electrophile, leading to the displacement of the halide as the leaving group. Below is a detailed, integrated hypothesis, including the specific components and their roles in the reaction mechanism:\n1.Electron-Deficient Aromatic Electrophile (General Component: Electron-Deficient Aromatic Electrophiles): The electron-deficient aromatic electrophile is crucial for making the carbon bonded to the halide more electrophilic and reactive to nucleophilic attack. A typical example is 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (specific component), which contains nitro groups that withdraw electron density from the aromatic ring, thereby enhancing the carbon’s electrophilicity. The IUPAC name of this compound is 2-chloro-1,3-dinitrobenzene, and its SMILES string is ClC1=CC(=C(C=C1N+[O-])N+)(N+[O-]). The electron-deficient nature of this electrophile makes it highly reactive toward nucleophiles, facilitating the substitution of the halide leaving group.\n2.Nucleophile (General Component: Nucleophiles): The nucleophile is critical for providing the electron pair necessary to attack the electrophilic carbon of the aromatic ring. Ethyl 2-cyanopropionate (specific component) serves as an ideal nucleophile, providing an enolate form that is activated by the enzyme to enhance nucleophilicity. The IUPAC name of this nucleophile is ethyl 2-cyano-3-phenylpropionate, and its SMILES string is CC(C(=O)OCC)C#N. The nucleophile attacks the electrophilic carbon of the aromatic ring, displacing the halide group. The enolate form is especially reactive because of its negative charge, which is stabilized by the enzyme, enhancing the reaction rate and ensuring a clean substitution.\n3.Halide-Binding Pocket (General Component: Halide-Binding Sites): The halide-binding pocket, formed by residues like Arg124 and Asp125 (specific components), stabilizes the halide as it departs during the reaction. This pocket ensures that the halide is correctly aligned for efficient leaving group activation. The hydrophobic nature of the pocket minimizes the steric clash between the halide and the rest of the active site while stabilizing the transition state. This stabilization lowers the activation energy of the reaction, facilitating the nucleophilic attack. The presence of this pocket ensures that the leaving group is positioned in a way that maximizes the efficiency of the substitution reaction.\n4.Hydrogen-Bonding Interaction (General Component: Hydrogen-Bond Donors): The interaction between the hydrogen-bond donor residue Arg124 (specific component) and the nucleophile (e.g., ethyl 2-cyanopropionate) is vital for activating the nucleophile and positioning it for attack on the electrophilic carbon. Arg124 donates a hydrogen bond to the enolate, which stabilizes the nucleophile and enhances its reactivity. This interaction ensures that the nucleophile is oriented correctly, contributing to the selectivity and stereoselectivity of the reaction. The hydrogen-bonding also plays a role in controlling the stereochemical outcome of the nucleophilic attack, ensuring that the desired stereoisomer is produced.\n5.Non-Covalent Mechanism (General Component: Non-Covalent Catalysis): The enzyme catalyzes the reaction via a non-covalent mechanism, meaning that no covalent enzyme-substrate intermediates are formed. Instead, the enzyme uses non-covalent interactions (like hydrogen bonding and halide binding) to stabilize the transition state and activate the nucleophile, facilitating the substitution reaction. This non-covalent pathway distinguishes the enzyme-catalyzed mechanism from traditional SN1 or SN2 mechanisms, which may involve covalent intermediates. By avoiding covalent intermediates, the enzyme ensures high selectivity, efficiency, and stereocontrol, enabling the reaction to proceed smoothly and efficiently."
hyp_example_hierarchy_5 = "The engineered enzyme SNAr1.3 catalyzes nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) reactions, where the nucleophile attacks an electron-deficient aromatic electrophile, leading to the displacement of the halide as the leaving group.\n1.Electron-Deficient Aromatic Electrophile (General Component: Electron-Deficient Aromatic Electrophiles):\nThe electron-deficient aromatic electrophile is essential for making the carbon attached to the halide more electrophilic and reactive to nucleophilic attack. A typical example is 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (specific component), which contains nitro groups that withdraw electron density from the aromatic ring, making the electrophilic carbon more reactive. The IUPAC name is 2-chloro-1,3-dinitrobenzene, and the SMILES string is ClC1=CC(=C(C=C1N+[O-])N+)(N+[O-]). This electron-withdrawing effect increases the electrophilicity of the carbon attached to the halide, facilitating its displacement by the nucleophile.\n2.Nucleophile (General Component: Nucleophiles):\nThe nucleophile is critical for providing the electron pair necessary to attack the electrophilic carbon on the aromatic ring. Ethyl 2-cyanopropionate (specific component) serves as the nucleophile, which provides an enolate that is activated by the enzyme to enhance its nucleophilicity. The IUPAC name for this nucleophile is ethyl 2-cyano-3-phenylpropionate, and its SMILES string is CC(C(=O)OCC)C#N. The enolate form of this nucleophile is highly reactive, allowing it to attack the electrophilic carbon and form a new C–C bond, displacing the halide leaving group.\n3.Halide-Binding Pocket (General Component: Halide-Binding Sites):\nThe enzyme features a halide-binding pocket, formed by residues like Arg124 and Asp125 (specific components), which stabilize the transition state and facilitate the departure of the halide leaving group. The pocket holds the halide in place, ensuring it is aligned properly for efficient departure. This stabilization lowers the activation energy of the reaction, ensuring the nucleophile can attack the electrophilic carbon efficiently.\n4.Hydrogen-Bonding Interaction (General Component: Hydrogen-Bond Donors):\nThe hydrogen-bond donor Arg124 (specific component) interacts with the nucleophile (e.g., ethyl 2-cyanopropionate) to activate it and position it for the nucleophilic attack on the electrophilic carbon. The hydrogen-bonding interaction stabilizes the nucleophile, ensuring proper alignment and enhancing its reactivity. This interaction contributes to the selectivity and stereoselectivity of the reaction, ensuring that the desired product is formed with high efficiency.\n5.Non-Covalent Mechanism (General Component: Non-Covalent Catalysis):\nThe enzyme catalyzes the reaction via a non-covalent mechanism, meaning there are no covalent enzyme-substrate intermediates. Instead, the enzyme uses non-covalent interactions (such as hydrogen bonding and halide binding) to stabilize the transition state and activate the nucleophile, facilitating the substitution reaction. This non-covalent mechanism distinguishes the enzyme’s catalysis from traditional SN1 and SN2 mechanisms, which often involve covalent intermediates. The use of non-covalent interactions contributes to high selectivity, efficiency, and stereocontrol in the reaction.\nExperimental Conditions:\n1.Reaction Temperature:\nThe reaction is carried out at room temperature (approximately 25°C) to maintain optimal enzyme activity. This temperature ensures that the enzyme is sufficiently active to catalyze the reaction without denaturation. Higher temperatures may be used to increase reaction rate but must be controlled to avoid compromising enzyme stability.\n2.Solvent System:\nThe reaction is performed in a polar organic solvent, such as dichloromethane (DCM) or ethanol, which effectively dissolves both the nucleophile and electron-deficient aromatic electrophile (e.g., 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene). These solvents provide a stable medium that supports efficient interaction between the reactants and the enzyme.\n3.Concentration of Reactants:\nThe electrophile (e.g., 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene) is typically used at a concentration of 10–20 mM, while the nucleophile (e.g., ethyl 2-cyanopropionate) is used in excess (2–3 times the molar concentration of the electrophile). The enzyme concentration is optimized to be 1–5 µM, ensuring efficient catalysis while minimizing substrate inhibition.\n4.	Reaction Time:\nThe reaction is typically allowed to proceed for 1–4 hours, depending on the desired yield and reaction rate. The reaction’s progress can be monitored via HPLC or GC, tracking the formation of the product and ensuring the reaction is proceeding as expected.\n5.Atmosphere:\nThe reaction is generally conducted under ambient air unless the enzyme is sensitive to oxygen or requires an inert atmosphere. For enzymes sensitive to oxidation, a nitrogen or argon atmosphere can be used to protect the enzyme from oxidative degradation.\n6.Work-Up Procedure:\nAfter the reaction, the mixture is quenched by adding water or a weak acid to neutralize the enzyme. The product is then extracted using an organic solvent like ethyl acetate, and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure. The product is purified using column chromatography or recrystallization, depending on its solubility and purity requirements.\n7.Purification and Yield:\nThe final product is purified using flash chromatography or thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The yield can reach up to 90% for well-optimized conditions, ensuring high turnover numbers and minimal by-products.\n"

# INTRODUCTION_OF_HIERARCHIES: added to the hierarchy greedy search prompt
INTRODUCTION_OF_HIERARCHIES = "Here we roughly classify all possible modifications into five hierarchies: (1) Mechanism of the Reaction: Describes how the reaction proceeds at a conceptual level, focusing on electron flow, bond formation and breaking, and any intermediates or transition states involved. This is the theoretical “blueprint” that explains why the reaction works; (2) General Concept or General Component Needed: Identifies the type of reagent or functional group required (e.g., “a strong acid,” “a Lewis base,” “an activated aromatic ring”) without committing to a specific chemical. It outlines the broader roles that are necessary for the mechanism to proceed; (3) Specific Components for the General Concept: Narrows down from the general category to a particular substance (e.g., “concentrated HCl” for a strong acid, “benzene” for an aromatic ring). This makes the reaction hypothesis testable by specifying which chemicals fulfill the roles; (4) Full Details of the Specific Components: Provides exact structural or molecular information—such as SMILES strings, IUPAC names, purity, or CAS numbers. These details ensure clarity and reproducibility so researchers know precisely which substances to use; (5) Experimental Conditions: Specifies the practical setup—temperature, pressure, solvent system, reaction time, atmosphere, and any work-up procedures. This final layer describes how to carry out the reaction in a laboratory setting. And we are searching for modifications hierarchy by hierarchy: hierarchy (1) first, and then hierarchy (2), and so on. Hypothesis from a higher hierarchy is an expansion of the hypothesis from its previous hierarchy, with additional information described above. "

FEEDBACK_NON_HIERARCHY_VALIDITY_CLARITY = [
    f"In terms of validity aspect, the ultimate goal is to search for the optimal hypothesis to tackle the research question. \
    Here are some examples in terms of the clarity aspect. Example 1: the added information (or some other existing information in the hypothesis) could be about 'adding Polyaromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) and Benzo[a]pyrene'. However, Instead of broadly mentioning polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as pollutants, research discussions should specify key compounds like benzo[a]pyrene (BaP, C₂₀H₁₂), a known carcinogen in cigarette smoke, grilled meats, and vehicle exhausts. Simply stating that 'PAHs are harmful' is vague—researchers should discuss how BaP forms DNA adducts through metabolic activation, leading to mutations and cancer risk. Experimental specifics, such as detecting BaP metabolites via HPLC-MS or studying its UV-induced degradation in water, make the discussion more precise and research-driven. \
    Example 2: the added information (or some other existing information in the hypothesis) could be about 'leveraging E1 elimination mechanism'. However, it is not enough to mention general concepts like the E1 elimination mechanism—you need to go deeper by specifying the exact chemicals and conditions relevant to your study. For example, stating that E1 occurs under 'high-temperature conditions' is too vague. Instead, you should specify a temperature range (e.g., 80–120°C) and discuss how different solvents or substrates influence the reaction outcome. Suppose you are studying dehydration of tert-butanol (C₄H₉OH) in sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) to form isobutene (C₄H₈). Instead of just mentioning 'a strong acid catalyzes E1,' explicitly state how 1M H₂SO₄ at 100°C increases the rate of carbocation formation, leading to a higher yield of isobutene. By providing specific chemical names, concentrations, and temperature ranges, your discussion moves from general theoretical concepts to precise experimental conditions that define your research proposal. \
    Example 3: the added information (or some other existing information in the hypothesis) could be about 'add xxx component can ensure xxx across a wide temperature range'. In example 3, the specific temperature range is not specified and you should point it out. Also in this example, the use of word 'ensure' is too strong and might not be valid (more soft word is preferred).
